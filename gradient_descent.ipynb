    "Gradient descent is a optimization algorithm used in linear regression to find the best fit line tohe data. It works by gradually by adjusting the lineâ€™s slope and intercept to reduce the difference between actual and predicted values. This process helps the model make accurate predictions by minimizing errors step by step. In this article we will see more about Gradient Descent and its core concepts in detail.\n",
